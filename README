Kangaroo is a web app that allows users to easily share files via the web.

The idea is to allow people to create a space to easily upload files to and then download them all as a zipped file.

This is still pre-alpha stuff, but hopefully it will make a great Merb app/slice someday soon.

Install instructions:
-------------------------
1. git clone git://github.com/bhb/kangaroo.git
2. cd kangaroo
3. thor merb:gem:redeploy
4. rake db:autoupgrade
5. ./bin/merb

Point your browser at http://localhost:4000

Usage Instructions
-------------------------
1. Create a new 'pouch' to hold your files
2. Upload files into your pouch
3. Download a zip of your files (at http://localhost:4000/pouches/show/<ID>.zip)

Todo list for alpha
-------------------------
- Add a link to download the zip file
- Put in a better uploader

Simple!
